        <h2>Realme 10 Pro+ 5G Review: Excellent Performance In An Elegant Package</h2>
        <p>Realme is known for launching extremely value-for-money smartphones, especially in the mid-range segment.
            Today, the company has launched the Realme 10 Pro and the Realme 10 Pro+, which come with excellent
            specifications and a beautiful design. It also comes with Realme‚Äôs latest software, Realme UI 4.0, based on
            Android 13. The phone is powered by a 5,000mAh battery that can charge very fast.</p>
        <p>With all these enticing features, can the Realme 10 Pro+ 5G become the best seller in the segment? Let us
            check its performance in our Realme 10 Pro+ 5G review.</p>

        <h3>Realme 10 Pro+ 5G Review</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Realme 10 Pro+ 5G</li>
            <li>67W Fast Charger</li>
            <li>USB Type-A To USB Type-C Cable</li>
            <li>SIM Ejector Tool</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We got the Nebula Blue version of the Realme 10 Pro+ 5G for review with 8GB RAM and 128GB internal storage.
        </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <img src="../../assets/images/img/post3-3.jpg" alt="post_1-1" width="100%" height="400vh" />
        <p>Realme always comes up with unique and eye-catching designs for its smartphones, and it has done the same
            with the Realme 10 Pro+. The phone is available in three colours in India: Dark Matter (Black), Hyperspace
            Gold, and Nebula Blue. The device is mainly made using plastic materials, including a plastic frame and a
            plastic back panel. Despite the cheaper material, the phone still feels well-built and looks great. Realme
            claims the phone has passed a 1m drop test and endured 28,000 micro drops without cracking.</p>
        <p>The phone is mainly covered by the screen on the front. The left and right sides of the screen curve to meet
            the back panel that also curves from the back. The top and bottom parts of the phone are flat, with a
            chamfered edge around the flat portion. The power and volume buttons, which are on the right side of the
            phone, are clicky and feel satisfying. The top of the phone has openings for the secondary microphone and
            the secondary loudspeaker. The bottom of the device has a dual-SIM card slot, a USB Type-C port, the primary
            microphone, and the primary loudspeaker. Unfortunately, there is no 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
        <p>While I can‚Äôt speak for the durability of the plastic frame and back panel, the phone looks attractive. It
            has two camera rings on the back, and the bottom ring houses two cameras: 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro. The
            Nebula Blue version of the phone shows the blue colour when you look at it straight. But when you tilt the
            phone a little, you can see shades of gold and pink. The Realme 10 Pro+ is the most attractive and premium
            feeling device from Realme‚Äôs number series. The only complaint I have from the phone in terms of the build
            is that it lacks any formal IP rating for dust and water resistance, and at this price, there should‚Äôve been
            at least an IP54 rating.</p>

        <h3>Display</h3>
        <img src="../../assets/images/img/post3-4.jpg" alt="post_1-2" width="100%" height="400vh" />
        <p>The 6.7-inch OLED screen on the Realme 10 Pro+ is excellent. It is bright, colourful, and feels very smooth.
            It has Full HD+ resolution and curved sides. Unlike its predecessor, the Realme 10 Pro+ has a centred
            display cutout for the selfie camera, and I personally like this arrangement as it looks symmetrical. The
            display refreshes at 120Hz, an upgrade over the Realme 9 Pro+‚Äôs 90Hz display. The screen is protected using
            AGC (Asahi Glass Co.) Dragontrail Pro panel, which feels quite strong. The display has an under-display
            optical fingerprint reader placed at the correct location.</p>
        <p>In terms of colour accuracy, the Realme 10 Pro+ was quite accurate, even in the Vivid (DCI-P3) mode. There
            was a slight blue tint, but you can switch to the Natural mode (sRGB) if you don‚Äôt like it. On top of this
            selection, Realme has also offered a colour temperature slider for further customisation.</p>
        <p>It can reach a peak brightness of 950 nits and has a native 10-bit colour depth. It also features a 2,160Hz
            PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for high-frequency dimming. This puts less strain on the eyes when using the
            phone in the dark (less than 100 nits screen brightness). Overall, the phone goes up to 500 nits of
            brightness by manually maxing out the brightness slider. In bright conditions, the phone automatically
            increases the brightness up to 800 nits. In HDR video playback, the display can reach a peak brightness of
            950 nits in certain parts.</p>
