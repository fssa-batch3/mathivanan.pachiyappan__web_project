        <h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max Launched</h2>
        <h3>Apple iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max Launched With 120Hz OLED Display, New 12MP Triple-Camera:
            Specifications, Features</h3>
        <p>During its California Streaming event, Apple unveiled the iPhone 13 series that includes four smartphones:
            iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max
            are the higher-end devices of the bunch. Both smartphones feature a design that‚Äôs similar to their
            predecessors, the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, respectively, but come in newer colours. They
            have brand new screens, a faster processor, improved cameras, higher storage options, and bigger batteries.
            Let us have a look at their designs, features, and specifications in detail.</p>
        <img src="../../assets/images/img/post3-1.jpg" alt="post_1-1" width="100%" height="300vh" />
        <h3>Apple iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max Features & Specifications</h3>
        <p>The Apple iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max are the first iPhones with high-refresh-rate OLED displays,
            and Apple calls its new displays ProMotion Super Retina XDR. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display,
            while the iPhone 13 Pro Max sports a 6.7-inch ProMotion OLED display. Screens on both smartphones feature
            Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz variable refresh rate (10Hz to 120Hz), Dolby Vision HDR, and Ceramic Shield
            protective glass. Apple says that the screens on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max vary their
            refresh rates depending on the content that‚Äôs being displayed to extend battery life. Apple still hasn‚Äôt
            managed to get rid of the ugly notch on the display, but it is now 20% smaller compared to the iPhone 12
            series.</p>
        <p>The iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max have exactly similar camera setups at the front and the rear.
            Both smartphones feature 12MP front-facing cameras with Face ID for secure Face Unlock. At the rear, both
            smartphones feature a newer and better triple-camera setup with a LiDAR sensor. There is a bigger 12MP
            primary camera sensor with an F1.5 aperture, dual-pixel PDAF, and sensor-shift OIS. Then there‚Äôs a 12MP
            ultrawide camera with autofocus and an F1.8 aperture. The 12MP telephoto camera has 3x optical zoom, OIS,
            and autofocus. The 3D ToF LiDAR sensor is used for depth measurement and AR apps.</p>
        <p>All the cameras on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max can record up to 4K 60fps videos in Dolby
            Vision HDR and 4K 30fps ProRes videos. Please note that 4K 30fps ProRes video recording is only supported on
            256GB or higher storage variants of the smartphones. 128GB variants are limited to 1080p 30fps ProRes video
            recording. Additionally, these new smartphones can also record Cinematic Mode videos that keep subjects
            (people, pets, and objects) in the frame automatically and offers a depth-of-field effect (similar to
            Portrait Mode for images). Slow-motion video recording is supported, too, but its resolution is limited to
            Full HD 1080p at 240fps. Time-Lapse videos support stabilisation and Night Mode.</p>

        <p>The iPhone 13 series uses Apple‚Äôs brand-new A15 Bionic processor. It is a 5nm chipset that features two new
            high-performance CPU cores, six new high-efficiency CPU cores, and a 5-core GPU. Apple claims that its new
            processor has a 50% faster CPU and a 50% faster GPU. Apple has finally ditched the 64GB storage variant for
            its new iPhones. The iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max come in four storage variants: 128GB, 256GB,
            512GB, and 1TB. Apple hasn‚Äôt disclosed how much RAM its new phones use, though. However, reports state that
            the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max feature 8GB of RAM.</p>
        <p>Connectivity features of these new smartphones include 5G (sub-6GHz and mmWave), GPS, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0,
            UWB (Ultra Wideband), NFC, and Lightning Port. Both smartphones use stainless steel frames and Ceramic
            Shield glass protection on the front. The iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max come in four colour
            variants: Gold, Graphite, Sierra Blue, and Silver.</p>
        <p>To support the high-refresh-rate display, Apple has increased the battery capacities of its new iPhones. The
            iPhone 13 Pro uses a 3,095mAh battery, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max is powered by a 4,352mAh battery. Apple
            claims that both phones last longer than their predecessors. Both devices support 20W fast wired charging,
            7.5W Qi wireless charging, and 15W MagSafe charging. Both smartphones support various MagSafe chargers,
            cases, mounts, and accessories. Other features include stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, an IP68 rating for
            dust and water resistance, and Apple Pay.</p>
