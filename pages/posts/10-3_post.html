        <h2>Xiaomi Redmi Pad Review: The Best Budget Android Tablet</h2>
        <p>The tablet market was dwindling since the launch of low-cost smartphones with big screens. Another reason for
            the decline of Android tablets was Android’s poor user experience, and app design optimizations for larger
            screens were nowhere near Apple’s iPad. However, the COVID-19 pandemic created the perfect environment for
            Android tablets to resurface the market, thanks to higher demand for online classes for kids. This inspired
            OEMs to create brand-new, cutting-edge tablets that were affordable. On top of this, the Android 12L release
            gave us a glimpse of Google’s serious consideration of optimising the Android user experience as a result.
        </p>
        <p>Cut to the first half of 2022, Xiaomi decided to take a chance and test the Indian market by releasing its
            Xiaomi Pad 5 tablet months after it was released internationally. The risk paid off handsomely, as the
            company was able to sell all of its initial stock within hours. The company has returned with a new tablet
            but under Redmi branding this time.</p>
        <p>The Xiaomi Redmi Pad is a budget tablet that makes an effort to offer everything to everyone at a reasonable
            price. It starts at just ₹14,999 and includes a large, 2K resolution display with a 90Hz refresh rate, a
            sizable battery, a decently powerful Helio G99 processor, and many other modern features. We have been using
            the Redmi Pad for a little more than three weeks and are prepared to respond to all of your burning
            questions regarding this awesome piece of technology. So let’s dive into our Xiaomi Redmi Pad review.</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>The Redmi Pad ships with the MIUI 13 overlay, which is based on Android 12. We are a bit disappointed,
            though, as the tablet doesn’t come pre-installed with the tablet-optimised version of Android: Android 12L.
            The software is remarkably tidy and fluid, though. The user interface showed no indication of any stutter in
            the UI during our three weeks-long use. Additionally, we found no issues with the software, and switching in
            and out between modes was a breeze. It is extremely uncommon to find bloatware in Xiaomi products, but MIUI
            13 for Pad practically lacks it, which is a good thing.</p>
        <img src="../../assets/images/img/post3-7.jpg" alt="post_1-1" width="100%" height="400vh" />
        <p>The number of features that MIUI puts on top of Android is something that is frequently seen. These consist
            of floating windows, split-screen multitasking mode, and more. Even while certain apps do not natively
            support split-screen, Xiaomi has said that it is collaborating with more developers to improve the Redmi Pad
            experience.</p>
        <p>One problem we faced during the Redmi Pad review is its RAM management. The aggressive RAM management on MIUI
            13 devices has been a recurring problem, and the Redmi Pad frequently shut down background apps to make way
            for the active app. If not addressed, this issue could irritate users.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <img src="../../assets/images/img/post3-6.jpg" alt="post_1-2" width="100%" height="400vh" />
        <p>Despite being a budget Android tablet, the Redmi Pad does not appear like one. It has an excellent in-hand
            feel because of its all-metal body. This Android tablet feels lighter than its actual weight of 465g, thanks
            to the flat frame design and even weight distribution. At 7.1mm, it is also relatively thin. While the edges
            of the tablet are flat, the corners are rounded to prevent digging into your hands, whether using it in
            portrait or landscape mode.</p>
        <p>The tablet comes in three colour options: Graphite Gray, Mint Green, and Moonlight Silver. For this review,
            we had the Graphite Gray version. Frankly, the Green colour is understated and blends well with other Xiaomi
            ecosystem products, such as the green version of the POCO F4. The body of the tablet has a matte textured
            finish, which deters most fingerprints and smudges.</p>

            finish, which deters most fingerprints and smudges.</p>

        <h3>Display</h3>
        <img src="../../assets/images/img/post3-5.jpg" alt="post_1-3" width="100%" height="400vh" />
        <p>We can appreciate the Redmi Pad’s wide, 10.61-inch display with a 2,000 x 1,200 pixels resolution. The device
            has a slight advantage over the competition because of its 90Hz refresh rate display and compatibility with
            up to a billion colours. The 90Hz refresh rate results in smooth animations and transitions, enhancing the
            user experience. In contrast to the Xiaomi Pad 5, though, there is no HDR10+ certification or Dolby Vision
            support here, but the 10-bit screen is still capable of 70% NTSC coverage and has a peak brightness of 400
            nits.</p>
        <p>The panel’s 15:9 aspect ratio makes it perfect for a variety of applications, including gaming, working, and
            watching videos. Additionally, the Redmi Pad has Widevine L1 certification, allowing you to watch Full HD
            content on Netflix and other video streaming (OTT) apps. This, coupled with the quad-speaker setup and Dolby
            Audio, makes for a solid streaming setup. The panel is compatible with any active styluses because there is
            no support for third-party accessories, which is still another drawback given that the closest rival, the
            OPPO Pad Air, includes one. Customers can still grab an inexpensive capacitive stylus from Amazon that works
            quite well.</p>

        <h3>Battery Life</h3>
        <p>A sizable 8,000mAh battery powers the Redmi Pad. The tablet has a loop test duration of approximately 15
            hours. It can easily last 3–4 days with mixed-use between charges because of the size of the screen and
            around a 5% battery loss in standby mode. The tablet ships with a 22.5W fast charger in the box, although
            the maximum charging power is only 18W. With the supplied brick, it takes over 2 hours and 30 minutes to
            fully top-up the battery.</p>
