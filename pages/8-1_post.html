        <h2>How to learn UI/UX Design?-Volume(3)</h2>
        <p>UX is an exciting field to explore, even if the idea of starting a career in the field can be a bit daunting,
            especially if you don‚Äôt have any UX design experience. In the world of UX design, there‚Äôs so much to learn
            and take in! The idea of going from complete novice to professional seems impossible. Surely you need some
            kind of design background? Or at least a vaguely relevant design qualification?</p>
        <p>Actually, you don‚Äôt. Anyone can become a UX designer‚Äîregardless of previous experience or current career. And
            you don‚Äôt need a university degree to succeed in this field!</p>
        <p>In fact, it seems that no two UX designers have the same background: just look at Claire, a former nurse, or
            Kaya, who retrained at thirty after traveling the globe.</p>
        <p>The biggest challenge is knowing where to start. The internet is a wealth of resources, but it‚Äôs important to
            structure your journey logically. Before you get lost down a UX rabbit hole, take a look at our 7-step guide
            to getting started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Read and research all things UX</li>
            <li> Understand what UX designers actually do</li>
            <li> Learn UX design tools</li>
            <li>Structure and formalize your learning with a UX design course or bootcamp</li>
            <li> Get inspired by the best designers</li>
            <li>Build your UX portfolio</li>
            <li> Start networking with other UX designers</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before we dive in, here‚Äôs a brief introduction from CareerFoundry‚Äôs Head of Career Services (and an
            experienced career coach), Mike McCulloch‚Äîhe‚Äôll give you an overview of what UX design is all about, what
            employers look for in a UX designer, and how to break into the field:</p>

        <h3>Read and research all things UX</h3>
        <p>UX design is such a broad field, so gather your resources and prepare to do some serious background research.
        </p>
        <p>First, make sure you know exactly what user experience design is: if you had to describe it in one sentence
            off the top of your head, what would you say? Understand the difference between UX and UI design, and the
            role that UX plays in business.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs also important to research the UX design job market. Scour job portals such as Indeed to see what kinds
            of UX roles are available in your area‚Äîand the skills and qualities they require. This should also give you
            an idea of salary ranges you can expect. For a deeper dive into the salary side of things, check out our
            full UX designer salary guide.</p>
        <p>At this stage, it‚Äôs all about getting an overview of the industry. Immerse yourself in UX design blogs and
            pick up a book or two‚Äîwe recommend starting with The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman.</p>
        <p>The more you read and research, the more sure you can be that UX design is right for you. For a simpler
            start, take a free UX design micro course to get an easy introduction to the field!</p>

        <h3>Understand what UX designers actually do</h3>
        <p>Now you know what the industry is all about, you can start to drill down to specifics. Next up is the
            question: What do UX designers actually do?</p>
        <p>From your research, you‚Äôll know that UX design is about solving problems. There‚Äôs a specific process UX
            designers follow to go about finding creative, innovative solutions to design problems. It‚Äôs call the design
            thinking process. There are five steps to this process. Here‚Äôs an overview:</p>
        <p>The very first step in the process is to identify the user problem for which you‚Äôll be designing. At this
            point, you‚Äôll focus on building empathy for the target user, carrying out polls and surveys, and creating
            problem statements.</p>
        <p>Once you‚Äôve defined the problem, you‚Äôll move on to the ideation phase. This is where the creativity
            begins‚Äîsketching ideas on paper, turning them into wireframes and, eventually, prototypes.</p>
        <p>After several rounds of user testing, you‚Äôll take your final design to the development stage. Having
            finalized your wireframe, you‚Äôll hand it over to a UI designer, who‚Äôll turn it into a high-fidelity
            wireframe ready for the development team.</p>
        <p>Of course, every designer works differently, but this should give you an idea of the overall process. Once
            you start working on your own projects, you‚Äôll no doubt develop your own way of doing things‚Äîand this
            includes finding your favourite tools. Which brings us to step number three.</p>
        <p>If you‚Äôre interested in a remote career, make sure you understand the unique perks and challenges of working
            as a remote UX designer.</p>
