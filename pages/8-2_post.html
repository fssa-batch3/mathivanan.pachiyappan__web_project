            <h2>How to learn UI/UX Design?-Volume(2)</h2>
            <h3>Learn UX design tools</h3>
            <p>As a UX designer, you’ll rely heavily on tools, so start by familiarizing yourself with the essentials. Again, the toolset will vary from designer to designer—but you’ll definitely need tools for the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User research: Survey and polling tools such as SurveyMonkey and Typeform, as well as user research platforms</li>
                <li>Wireframing: Sketch, Balsamiq, Wireframe.cc, Figma, and many more. Check out our guide to free wireframing tools.</li>
                <li>Prototyping: Adobe XD, InVision, Sketch, and more. Check out our guide to the best prototyping tools for UX designers.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>These are just a few examples; you’ll also work with project management tools and communication platforms—but these are the ones that are specific to the design process, making them a good place to start. Wherever possible, sign up for a free account and just play around with the tool’s functions and features. Once you’ve got the basics, it’s also worth watching some video tutorials.</p>
            <p>In addition to the tools mentioned previously, check out this round-up of six awesome (and free!) design resources:</p>
            <p>It might seem strange to use these tools with no real context, but knowing your way around even just a little bit will make your life much easier once you start working on real design projects!</p>

            <h3>Structure and formalize your learning with a UX design course or bootcamp</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/img/post_1-1.jpg" width="100%" height="30%"/>
            <p>So you’ve done your research and you know exactly what UX design is. You’re aware of how UX designers work, and you’ve experimented with some of the most popular industry tools. At this point, we’ll assume you’ve enjoyed the journey so far and want to keep going.</p>
            <p>If you’re serious about a career in UX design, the easiest way to make the transition from newbie to pro is through a structured course. Before you start backing away, let’s be clear: you don’t need to go to university or spend years studying. In fact, employers aren’t looking for tons of qualifications—they just want to see that you’ve mastered the key principles and practical skills.</p>
            <p>The right UX design course will take you through the essentials in a logical order and, most importantly, save you from the information overload of the world wide web! Before choosing a course, be sure to conduct thorough research: can you study flexibly at your own pace? Will you be supported by a mentor and a community of fellow learners? Will you work on real-world projects that build up your portfolio, and is there a job guarantee? For a course that offers all of these things, be sure to check out our UX Design Program. And if you’re considering a UX design internship, here’s a guide that will help you decide: Should I Do A UX Design Bootcamp Or A UX Design Internship?</p>
