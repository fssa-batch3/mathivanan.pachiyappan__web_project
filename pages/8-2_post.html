        <h2>How to learn UI/UX Design?-Volume(2)</h2>
        <h3>Learn UX design tools</h3>
        <p>As a UX designer, you‚Äôll rely heavily on tools, so start by familiarizing yourself with the essentials.
            Again, the toolset will vary from designer to designer‚Äîbut you‚Äôll definitely need tools for the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User research: Survey and polling tools such as SurveyMonkey and Typeform, as well as user research
                platforms</li>
            <li>Wireframing: Sketch, Balsamiq, Wireframe.cc, Figma, and many more. Check out our guide to free
                wireframing tools.</li>
            <li>Prototyping: Adobe XD, InVision, Sketch, and more. Check out our guide to the best prototyping tools for
                UX designers.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>These are just a few examples; you‚Äôll also work with project management tools and communication platforms‚Äîbut
            these are the ones that are specific to the design process, making them a good place to start. Wherever
            possible, sign up for a free account and just play around with the tool‚Äôs functions and features. Once
            you‚Äôve got the basics, it‚Äôs also worth watching some video tutorials.</p>
        <p>In addition to the tools mentioned previously, check out this round-up of six awesome (and free!) design
            resources:</p>
        <p>It might seem strange to use these tools with no real context, but knowing your way around even just a little
            bit will make your life much easier once you start working on real design projects!</p>

        <h3>Structure and formalize your learning with a UX design course or bootcamp</h3>
        <img src="../assets/images/img/post_1-1.jpg" alt="post-1-1" width="100%" height="30%" />
        <p>So you‚Äôve done your research and you know exactly what UX design is. You‚Äôre aware of how UX designers work,
            and you‚Äôve experimented with some of the most popular industry tools. At this point, we‚Äôll assume you‚Äôve
            enjoyed the journey so far and want to keep going.</p>
        <p>If you‚Äôre serious about a career in UX design, the easiest way to make the transition from newbie to pro is
            through a structured course. Before you start backing away, let‚Äôs be clear: you don‚Äôt need to go to
            university or spend years studying. In fact, employers aren‚Äôt looking for tons of qualifications‚Äîthey just
            want to see that you‚Äôve mastered the key principles and practical skills.</p>
        <p>The right UX design course will take you through the essentials in a logical order and, most importantly,
            save you from the information overload of the world wide web! Before choosing a course, be sure to conduct
            thorough research: can you study flexibly at your own pace? Will you be supported by a mentor and a
            community of fellow learners? Will you work on real-world projects that build up your portfolio, and is
            there a job guarantee? For a course that offers all of these things, be sure to check out our UX Design
            Program. And if you‚Äôre considering a UX design internship, here‚Äôs a guide that will help you decide: Should
            I Do A UX Design Bootcamp Or A UX Design Internship?</p>
