        <h2>How to learn UI/UX Design?-Volume(1)</h2>
        <h3>Get inspired by the best designers</h3>
        <p>In addition to studying key UX design principles and methods, you can also work on developing your
            ‚Äúdesigner‚Äôs eye.‚Äù Surround yourself with inspiration: check out portfolios on sites like bestfolios.com, the
            Adobe blog and Dribbble to see what other designers are up to. In doing so, you‚Äôll start to think like a
            UXer and build up your own ideas of what good and bad design look like.</p>
        <p>Indeed, inspiration is something you‚Äôll need throughout your UX career‚Äînot just when starting out. Keeping an
            eye on industry trends, following other designers on social media and scouring the internet for fresh ideas
            will keep the creative juices flowing and continuously broaden your design horizons.</p>

        <h3>Build your UX portfolio</h3>
        <img src="../assets/images/img/post_1-2.jpg" alt="post_1-1" width="100%" height="30%">
        <p>This step is absolutely crucial‚Äîespecially when you start applying for jobs. Employers want to see what
            you‚Äôre capable of, so a resume alone will not cut it. But how do you fill your portfolio with show-stopping
            design work if you‚Äôre completely new to the field?</p>
        <p>One great way to fill up your portfolio is to volunteer. Reach out to non-profit organizations to see if they
            need help improving their UX, or search the internet for virtual volunteering opportunities. Another option
            is to fake it til you make it‚Äîand by fake it we mean, work on made-up projects. Pretend you are a client and
            set yourself a design challenge, or pick a random website or app and redesign it. Be sure to document each
            stage of the process so you can clearly demonstrate how you reached the final design solution. Of course,
            it‚Äôs important to make it clear to potential employers that these are practice projects rather than paid
            work.</p>
        <p>If you study UX with CareerFoundry, you don‚Äôt need to worry so much about finding projects for your
            portfolio. Throughout the course, you‚Äôll work on creating a set of mobile app designs‚Äîand we‚Äôll also help
            you publish your portfolio online and create a video demo of your work.</p>

        <h3>Start networking with other UX designers</h3>
        <p>If you really want to learn UX design, never underestimate the value of your peers. Networking is a constant
            source of education, and you‚Äôll learn so much about the industry just by chatting to those who know it best.
        </p>
        <p>Local meetups and events are great, but it‚Äôs not always feasible to be there in person‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre
            working and studying UX at the same time! Fortunately, there are plenty of online communities, from LinkedIn
            groups and forums to the CareerFoundry community of tutors, mentors and fellow learners! If you‚Äôre keen to
            make some connections online before you start your new career, check out these Top 12 Design Communities for
            UX/UI Designers and Developers.</p>
