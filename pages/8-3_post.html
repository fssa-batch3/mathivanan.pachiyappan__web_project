            <h2>How to learn UI/UX Design?-Volume(3)</h2>
            <h3>Get inspired by the best designers</h3>
            <p>In addition to studying key UX design principles and methods, you can also work on developing your “designer’s eye.” Surround yourself with inspiration: check out portfolios on sites like bestfolios.com, the Adobe blog and Dribbble to see what other designers are up to. In doing so, you’ll start to think like a UXer and build up your own ideas of what good and bad design look like.</p>
            <p>Indeed, inspiration is something you’ll need throughout your UX career—not just when starting out. Keeping an eye on industry trends, following other designers on social media and scouring the internet for fresh ideas will keep the creative juices flowing and continuously broaden your design horizons.</p>

            <h3>Build your UX portfolio</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/img/post_1-2.jpg" alt="post_1-1" width="100%" height="30%">
            <p>This step is absolutely crucial—especially when you start applying for jobs. Employers want to see what you’re capable of, so a resume alone will not cut it. But how do you fill your portfolio with show-stopping design work if you’re completely new to the field?</p>
            <p>One great way to fill up your portfolio is to volunteer. Reach out to non-profit organizations to see if they need help improving their UX, or search the internet for virtual volunteering opportunities. Another option is to fake it til you make it—and by fake it we mean, work on made-up projects. Pretend you are a client and set yourself a design challenge, or pick a random website or app and redesign it. Be sure to document each stage of the process so you can clearly demonstrate how you reached the final design solution. Of course, it’s important to make it clear to potential employers that these are practice projects rather than paid work.</p>
            <p>If you study UX with CareerFoundry, you don’t need to worry so much about finding projects for your portfolio. Throughout the course, you’ll work on creating a set of mobile app designs—and we’ll also help you publish your portfolio online and create a video demo of your work.</p>

            <h3>Start networking with other UX designers</h3>
            <p>If you really want to learn UX design, never underestimate the value of your peers. Networking is a constant source of education, and you’ll learn so much about the industry just by chatting to those who know it best.</p>
            <p>Local meetups and events are great, but it’s not always feasible to be there in person—especially if you’re working and studying UX at the same time! Fortunately, there are plenty of online communities, from LinkedIn groups and forums to the CareerFoundry community of tutors, mentors and fellow learners! If you’re keen to make some connections online before you start your new career, check out these Top 12 Design Communities for UX/UI Designers and Developers.</p>
