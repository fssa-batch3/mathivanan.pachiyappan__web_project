            <h2>Elements of a network</h2>
            <p>In order to understand networks we need to understand the elements of a network. There are four main elements that define how communication over networks works.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rules or agreements to govern how the messages are sent, directed, received and interpreted – examples include protocols.</li>
                <li>The messages or units of information that travel from one device to another – these may be packets, frames among others.</li>
                <li>A means of interconnecting these devices – a medium that can transport the messages from one device to another – such as copper cables, fibre optic among others.</li>
                <li>Devices on the network that exchange messages with each other – these may include ip phones, computers, servers, routers among others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this course, we will use several network devices, from these, we will create simple and complex topologies, based on the requirements. Keep these in mind because they will be used throughout the course as well as the exams.</p>

            <h3>Converged network</h3>
            <p>The world of networks has grown over the years. We are finding more and more ways to use computer networks. Communication over networks today is not just limited to transmitting static data, rather new applications such as teleconferencing, video, news and other multimedia applications can be found on computer networks.</p>
            <p>In yester years, communication was segmented. There were different networks for each application.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For voice, there were telephone networks,</li>
                <li>For video, there were TV and cable service providers</li>
                <li>For data there were internet service providers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, all these services can be provided over the same network and this has been attributed to the growth of computer networks. Therefore, a converged network is one in which all these services; data, voice, and audio, are provided over the same network.</p>
            <p>This essentially eliminates the need for multiple service providers for each of these services.</p>
            
            <h3>Other concepts.</h3>
            <p>Fault tolerance and scalability – this means that networks should be able to recover from down time or other faults and should be able to expand as needed.</p>
            <p>Quality of service – this is a measurement instituted in networks so as to ensure that the services provided in a converged network work optimally. For example communication would be poor, if a network had only video and not audio when a business executive is in a video conference call. To ensure quality of service, different services are given different priorities.</p>
            <p>Security – the network should be safe from intrusions from unauthorized access. This would ensure that communication is effective and confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is maintained.</p>
